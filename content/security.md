## Security

At Huisky Staking + Mev, we prioritize security to ensure the reliability and trustworthiness of our staking operations. Here are the key measures we have implemented:

### Hot Swap Backup Server

We have a hot swap backup server ready to take over in case of emergencies. This ensures that our services continue without interruption even if our main server encounters an issue.

### Zero Downtime Upgrade

Our infrastructure is designed to allow for zero downtime upgrades. This means we can perform necessary maintenance and updates without affecting the availability of our staking services and generate maximum staking rewards.

### Monitoring

We use a realtime pager setup to monitor our staking program around the clock. This setup allows us to receive immediate alerts and respond promptly to any issues, ensuring the smooth operation of our staking services.

### Data Center Security

Our datacenter facilities are equipped with robust security measures to protect against various risks. These include:
- **UPS**: Uninterruptible Power Supply to ensure continuous power.
- **Diesel Generator**: Backup power source in case of prolonged outages.
- **Chilled-Loop HVAC**: Efficient cooling system to maintain optimal operating temperatures.
- **Two-Phase Fire Suppression**: Advanced fire suppression system to prevent and control fires.
- **Digital Cameras**: Continuous surveillance to monitor and record activities.
- **Keyscan Controlled Access Systems**: Restricted access to sensitive areas to enhance security.

### Cold Wallet Key Management

We use cold wallet keys to manage staking operations. This provides an additional layer of security by keeping our keys offline, protecting them from potential online threats.
